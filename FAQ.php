        <h3>Why is there an expand and collapse button in the recipe page?</h3>
        <p>This is most convenient for users who already made a certain recipe before but would like to be reminded of the major steps in creating that recipe. So, when collapsed, you only see the main instruction for each stage.</p>

        <h3>What is the question-mark button in the homepage?</h3>
        <p>This button generates a random recipe for you when you're not sure what to cook and encourages you to explore new kinds of recipes! Try something new!</p>
